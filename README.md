# NOAA Alerts Pushover

Sends out NOAA Severe Weather Alerts via [Pushover](http://www.pushover.net). Any time a new alert is created for your monitored counties, you'll receive a push notification on your devices.

## Features

- üå™Ô∏è Real-time severe weather alerts from NOAA
- üì± Push notifications via Pushover
- üó∫Ô∏è Monitor multiple counties across the US
- üîï Filter out unwanted alert types
- üê≥ Docker and Docker Compose support
- üíæ SQLite database to prevent duplicate notifications
- üîÑ Automatic cleanup of expired alerts

## Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/k9barry/noaa-alerts-pushover.git
   cd noaa-alerts-pushover
   ```

2. **Configure your settings:**
   ```bash
   cp config.txt.example config.txt
   # Edit config.txt with your Pushover credentials
   ```

3. **Edit counties.json** to add the counties you want to monitor. Find county codes on the [NOAA website](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/winugc.htm).

4. **Validate your setup (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 test_setup.py
   ```

5. **Run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The service will check for alerts once and exit. To run continuously, see the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

## Manual Installation (Python)

If you prefer to run without Docker:

1. **Install Python 3.12+ and dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure your settings:**
   ```bash
   cp config.txt.example config.txt
   # Edit config.txt with your Pushover credentials
   ```

3. **Edit counties.json** to monitor your desired counties.

4. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   python models.py
   ```

5. **Validate your setup:**
   ```bash
   python test_setup.py
   ```

6. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python fetch.py
   ```

## Configuration

### Pushover Credentials

Create a `config.txt` file with your Pushover API credentials:

```ini
[pushover]
token = YOUR_PUSHOVER_TOKEN
user = YOUR_PUSHOVER_USER_KEY
```

*Get your credentials at the [Pushover website](http://www.pushover.net).*

### Counties to Monitor

Edit the `counties.json` file to add counties you wish to monitor:

```json
[
    {
        "fips": "012057",
        "name": "Hillsborough County",
        "state": "FL",
        "ugc": "FL057"
    }
]
```

Find county codes at the [NOAA website](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/winugc.htm).

### Filtering Alerts (Optional)

To ignore specific alert types, add them to your `config.txt`:

```ini
[events]
ignored = Red Flag Warning,Heat Advisory
```

## Usage

### Command-Line Options

- **Standard run:** `python fetch.py`
- **Clear all alerts:** `python fetch.py --purge`
- **Disable push notifications:** `python fetch.py --nopush`
- **Debug mode:** `python fetch.py --debug`

### Running on a Schedule

For continuous monitoring, set up a cron job or use the Docker Compose configuration with a loop. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details.
